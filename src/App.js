        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Lauren Bryant. I am a very hard worker, who is used to
          collaborating with a team, but can also work well in isolation. I work
          full-time as a Beauty Advisor who is in training to be the Beauty
          Department Lead. I am also very great at handling difficult schedules
          and multi-tasking. I have been a full-time worker, while also being a
          full-time student at the same time. Even right now I am currently
          enrolled in the UNC Chapel Hill's Coding Camp while also working
          full-time. So I am very good at managing my priorities and getting stuff
          done! I enjoy reading, playing video games, gardening, and coding in my
          free time. I hope that you find that my projects and this biography show
          you that I am an eligible candidate to working with you. Enjoy the rest
          of my page!
